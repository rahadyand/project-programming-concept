# project-programming-concept
This repository contains our first semester final project: an educational game built in C++ by my team. It was created to practice core programming concepts like variables, conditions, loops, and functions in a fun, interactive way. The code is beginner-friendly and can be improved or expanded for future learning and group projects in this repo.
