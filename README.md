# 🎮 Project Programming Concept – Educational Game

Welcome to **Project Programming Concept**!  
This repository contains our **1st semester final project**: a simple **educational game** built in **C++** 👩‍💻👨‍💻  
Our goal is to make learning programming concepts more **fun, interactive, and easy to understand**.

---

## 📚 About the Project

This game is designed to help beginners understand basic **programming concepts**, such as:

- 🔤 Variables  
- 🔁 Loops  
- 🔀 Conditions (`if` / `else`)  
- 🧩 Functions  
- 📂 Basic program structure  

We created this project as a **team assignment**, combining logic, creativity, and clean code.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Educational gameplay** – learn while playing  
- 💬 **Simple text-based interface** (console)  
- 🎯 **Beginner-friendly C++ code**  
- 🧱 Clear structure to help understand how a C++ project is organized  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 💻 **Language**: C++  
- 🧷 **Paradigm**: Basic procedural programming  
- 🧰 **Tools/IDE**: _Fill here (e.g. VS Code, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, etc.)_
